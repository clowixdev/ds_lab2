# Laboratory work for University

### Calculator (postfix notation algorithm)

In this laboratory work we have to write a program that calculates expressions based on the postfix notation algorithm for calculating values and the sorting station algorithm using stack and queue data structures.

In this calculator you can write any expressions including expressions with variables and complex mathematic functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.)

Stack and queue are implemented using linked lists and all their logic is written separately from main file
